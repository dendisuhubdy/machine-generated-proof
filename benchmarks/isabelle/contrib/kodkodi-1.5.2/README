The pre-built Java libraries are located in the "jar" subdirectory.
Precompiled JNI libraries of MiniSat, CryptoMiniSat, Lingeling, and
Plingeling (also available at http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/) are
located in "jni". Kodkodi's source files in "src" are covered by the
license found in the file "LICENSES/Kodkodi". The Kodkodi manual is
called "manual/kodkodi.pdf".

This package includes the following third-party tools in source and/or
binary form:

  * ANTLR 3.1.1 runtime ("jar/antlr-runtime-3.1.1.jar"):
    Custom subset of http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.1.1.jar.

  * Kodkod 1.5 ("jar/kodkod-1.5.jar"):
    Downloaded from http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/release/kodkod.jar.

  * SAT4J 2.3 ("jar/sat4j-2.3"):
    Extracted from
    http://forge.ow2.org/project/download.php?group_id=228&file_id=16503.

  * JNI versions of MiniSat 1.14/2.2.0, CryptoMiniSat 2.9.1, and
    Lingeling/Plingeling 276 ("jni/*"):
    Most of these come from
    http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/release/linux_x86_32.zip,
    http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/release/linux_x86_64.zip, and
    http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/release/darwin_x86_64.zip. The Cygwin
    and ".jnilib" Mac OS X MiniSat libraries were taken from Alloy
    4.1.10, previously available at
    http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy4/alloy4.jar. The SAT solver sources are
    available as part of
    http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/release/kodkod-1.5.zip.

Each of these tools comes with its own license, which can be found in
the "LICENSES" directory. Be aware that zChaff is licensed for
